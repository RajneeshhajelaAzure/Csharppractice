Long-Term Solutions
Move to Microservices Architecture: Deploy each microservice in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for better resource management and scaling.
Optimize Database Architecture: database sharding or partitioning for large tables to improve read/write performance.read replicas for high-read scenarios and separate the read and write databases to reduce load on the primary database.NoSQL databases (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB) for parts of the application requiring high availability and low-latency reads/writes.
 Distributed Caching: Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis Cache, Azure Cache for Redis) for frequently accessed data like session data, user profiles, and product information to reduce dependency on the database.
Implement in-memory caching for compute-heavy operations, leveraging the local cache at the application level for even faster data retrieval.
Implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing:For high-traffic e-commerce or ordering systems, use the CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations, which optimizes database access.Use event sourcing to ensure data consistency and scale independently, particularly in high-availability systems.
